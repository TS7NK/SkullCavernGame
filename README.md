# Skull Cavern: Diamond Quest

I'm a big fan of Stardew Valley, so I decided to create a game inspired by the Skull Cavern. The player's goal is to kill monsters and crack stones to find the ladder to the next level. The player wins by reaching the 3rd-level ladder with 3 diamonds; otherwise, they lose.

This game was developed using **OpenGL**, providing an immersive graphical experience with real-time rendering.

## Features

- **Challenging Gameplay**: Navigate through multiple levels filled with monsters and obstacles.
- **Monster Battles**: Engage in combat with various enemies to progress.
- **Resource Collection**: Crack stones to uncover diamonds and hidden paths.
- **Victory Condition**: Strategically gather 3 diamonds and find the final ladder to win.
- **OpenGL-Powered Graphics**: Enjoy smooth and visually appealing 2D/3D graphics powered by OpenGL.

## Requirements

- **General**:
  - C++ compiler supporting OpenGL (e.g., GCC, Clang).
  - OpenGL development libraries (GLUT or GLFW recommended).

- **For Mac Users**:
  - **Xcode**: Recommended for building and running the game on macOS.
    - Install Xcode from the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835).
    - Ensure you have the Xcode Command Line Tools installed:
      ```bash

  - OpenGL is included with macOS by default, but you may need to install additional dependencies (e.g., freeglut or glfw).
